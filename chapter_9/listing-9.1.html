    /*
      IMPORTANT NOTES:

      - The eval(...) function in JavaScript takes a string as an argument, and treats the contents of
        the string as if it had actually been authored code at that point the program. In other words,
        you can programmatically generate code inside of your authored code, and run the generated code
        as if it had been there at author time.

      - eval(...) when used in a strict-mode program operates in its own lexical scope, which means
        declarations made inside of the eval() do NOT actually modify the enclosing scope.
        -> Lexical scope means that scope is defined by author-time decisions of where functions are
          declared. The lexing phase of compilation is essentially able to know where and how all identifiers
          are declared, and thus predict how they will be looked-up during execution.
        -> Two mechanisms in JavaScript can "cheat" lexical scope: eval(...) and with(). With eval(...), it can
           modify existing lexical scope (at runtime) by evaluating a string of "code" which has one or more
           declarations in it.
        -> The downside to these mechanisms is that it defeats the Engine's ability to perform compile-time
           optimizations regarding scope look-up, because the Engine has to assume pessimistically that
           such optimizations will be invalid. Code will run slower as a result of using either feature (Don't misuse them!!)

      - Within JavaScript there are a number of different mechanisms for evaluating code and there are:
        1) The eval() method
          - The eval() method executes the code passed into it in string form, within the current context.
        2) Function constructors
        3) Timers
        4) The <script> element

      - Basic Eval() Functionality:
        1) It will evaluate the code passed to it as a string.
        2) It will execute that code in the scope within which eval() is called.

      - Evaluation Results:
        1) The eval() method will return the result of the LAST expression in the passed code string.
        2) Ex: eval('3+4;5+6') -> 11
        3) Ex: eval('{ninja: 1}') -> 1 (needs to wrap object with parentheses!!)
        4) Ex: eval('( {ninja: 1} )') -> {ninja: 1} -> parentheses are IMPORTANT here!!

      - eval() returns the result of the last expression in the passed in string.
        1) the last expression -> it should be noted that anything that isn't a simple variable,
                                  primitive, or assignment will need to be wrapped in parentheses!!

    // the correct value to be returned!!
