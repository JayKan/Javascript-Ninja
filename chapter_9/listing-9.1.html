  <!-- 9.1: Basic test of the eval() method -->
  <script>
    /*
      NOTES:

      - Within JavaScript there are a number of different mechanisms for evaluating code and there are:
        1) The eval() method
          - The eval() method executes the code passed into it in string form, within the current context.
        2) Function constructors
        3) Timers
        4) The <script> element

      - Basic Eval() Functionality:
        1) It will evaluate the code passed to it as a string.
        2) It will execute that code in the scope within which eval() is called.

      - Evaluation Results:
        1) The eval() method will return the result of the LAST expression in the passed code string.
        2) Ex: eval('3+4;5+6') -> 11
        3) Ex: eval('{ninja: 1}') -> 1 (needs to wrap object with parentheses!!)
        4) Ex: eval('( {ninja: 1} )') -> {ninja: 1} -> parentheses are IMPORTANT here!!
     */

    /*
      Tests a simple expression.
     */
    assert( eval('5 + 5') === 10,
    '9.1: 5 and 5 is 10');

    /*
      Tests a valueless evaluation.
      - creates a side effect of var ninja = 5;
      - eval() returns the result of the last expression in the passed in string.
        1) the last expression -> it should be noted that anything that isn't a simple variable,
                                  primitive, or assignment will need to be wrapped in parentheses!!
     */
    assert( eval('var ninja = 5;') === undefined,
    '9.1: No value should be defined.');

    var result = eval('3+4;5+5'); // it should returns 10;
    console.log(result);

    var a = eval('{ninja:1}'); // it returns 1
    console.log(a);

    // now it returns the object you want!
    // Remember, objects need to be wrapped with parentheses in order for
    // the correct value to be returned!!
    var b = eval('({ninja: 1})');
    console.log(b);



    /*
      Verifies the side effect.
     */
    assert( ninja === 5,
    '9.1: Side effect: The variable ninja NOW was created after running above assert() first :(');

    /*
      Tests evaluation scope.
     */
    (function(){
      eval('var ninja = 6');
      assert( ninja === 6,
      '9.1: Evaluated within the current scope, which was created via immediate function closure :)');
    })();

    /*
      Test for scope 'leakage'.
     */
    assert( window.ninja === 5,
    '9.1: The global scope was unaffected.');

    assert( ninja === 5,
    '9.1 Teh global scope was unaffected again!');
