      Demonstrates various ways we can use eval() to create Objects or Functions:
      1) Uses parentheses to wrap your string arguments as the last expression to be executed, OR
      2) Uses false||{}||function(){} syntax will work too in the absence of the parentheses!

      Creates an object from a string containing an object literal
      and tests that not only was the object created, but it has the
      expected name property.

      - Creates an Ninja object via eval() on the fly!
     */
    var ninja = eval( 'false||{name: \'Ninja\'}' );
    assert( ninja !== undefined,
    '9.2: Ninja was not undefined, it was created via eval()...');
    assert( ninja.name === 'Ninja',
    '9.2: and with the expected name property/value...');

    /*
      Creates a function from a function literal in a string
      and tests that the function was created and returns the
      expected value when called.

    /*
      Tries to create another version of the first test, leaving off the
      parentheses. The 1st test passes, but the 2nd test fails (below example)
      because the object was not created as expected ( value of 'Ninja' was created instead )

      - A quick to fix ninja2 is to use || operator,
        Ex: eval('false||{name:"Ninja"}') OR, eval('({name:"Ninja"})')
