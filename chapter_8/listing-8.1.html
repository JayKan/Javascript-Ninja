  <!-- 8.1: Two ways to create repeating timers -->
  <script>
    /*
      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - JavaScript, by nature, is single-threaded (only one piece of JavaScript code can execute at a time),
        timers provide a way to dance around this restriction, resulting in a rather oblique way of executing code.
      - JavaScript provides us with two methods to create timers and two methods to clear them:
        1) setTimeout: creates a timer
        2) clearTimeout: clears a timer
        3) setInterval: creates an interval timer
        4) clearInterval: clears the interval timer
      - Recap:
        1) JavaScript engines execute ONLY a single thread at a time, forcing asynchronous events
           to queue up awaiting execution.
        2) If a timer is blocked from immediately executing, it will be delayed until the next available
           time of execution (which may be longer, but NEVER shorter, than the specified time)
        3) Intervals may end up executing back to back with no delay if they get backed up enough,
           and multiple instances of the same interval handler will never be queued up.

      1st Way: Sets up a timeout that reschedules itself every 10 milliseconds.

    setTimeout(function repeatMe(){
      /* Some long block of code ... */
      setTimeout(repeatMe, 10);
    }, 10);

    /*
      2nd Way: Sets up an interval that triggers every 10 milliseconds.
     */
    setInterval(function(){
      /* Some long block of code ... */
    }, 10);
