      Again, the instance method 'swingSword()' takes precedence. This makes
      perfect sense since the prototype is only consulted when a property reference
      on the object itself fails! Because the object itself directly possesses a 'swingSword'
      property, the prototyped version doesn't come into play.

      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - Property references are resolved in the object first, defaulting to inspecting the
        prototype only if that fails.
