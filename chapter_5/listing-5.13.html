        When we get called with a key, we check to see if we have a cached value for it.
        If so, we return it. If not, we call the function and store its values for next time.
        What's interesting about the proceeding code is that we do the 'computation' and the 'save'
        in a single step. The value is computed via apply() call to the function, and it's saved directly to the data store.
        Since this statement, apply() call is within the return statement, meaning that the resulting value is also
        returned from the parent function. So the entire chain of events - computing the value, saving the value,
        and returning the value - is done within a single logical unit of code here. (Very interesting!!)
