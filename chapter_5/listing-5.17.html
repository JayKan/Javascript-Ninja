          We expect each handler to report the DIV number;
          However, i is always going to be 2 in this case.

          IMPORTANT NOTES:
          - This is a common issue with closures and looping; namely that the variable
            that's being closured (i in this case) is being updated after the function is bound.
            This means that every bound function handler will always alert the last value stored in i, in our case its 2.
            Closures remember references to included variables - not just their values at the time at which they're created.

//    }

    /*
      This is the correct working version for above code.
      How are we ensuring variable i being closured to each loop? (Leverage closures with immediate functions)
      - By using an immediate function as the body of the for loop, we enforce the correct
        ordinal value (i) for the handlers by passing that value into the immediate function (and hence, the closure of the inner function).
        This means that within the scope of each step of the for loop, the 'i' variable is defined
        anew, giving the closure of the click handler the correct value.
      - This example clearly points out how we can control the scope of variables and values using immediate functions and closures.
