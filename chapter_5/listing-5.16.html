    /*
      The immediate function expects a single parameter that it names $.
      Within the function this parameter overrides any use of $ in a higher scope.
      In other words, within the function body, the parameter $ will take precedence over
      the global variable $, which we have redefines above.

      What Immediate Functions can help && do:
        - Creates a function instance
        - Executes the function
        - Discards the function (as there are no longer any references to it after the statement has ended)
        - Creates temporary variables within a scope (short name into a limited scope)
        - Solves nasty issues with loops and closures
     */
    (function($){
      /*
        Inside the function we use the $ as if it were still assigned to jQuery.
        Note that we not only use the $ in the function, we also use it in the event handler.
        Even though the event handler will be called much later, the $ parameter is bound
        to it by its closure. [ Awesome closure !!! ]

        In calling the immediate function, we pass jQuery as the sole argument.
        This binds jQuery to the $ parameter; thus innerFunction can have access to $ (jQuery)
