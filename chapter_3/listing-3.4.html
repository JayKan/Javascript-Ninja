    // IMPORTANT NOTES: Invocation as a constructors
    // When a constructor is invoked, the following special actions take place:
    //  1) A new empty object is created.
    //  2) The object is passed to the constructor as the 'this' parameter, and thus becomes the constructor's function context.
    //  3) In the absence of any explicit return value, the new object is returned as the value constructor's value.

    // Defines a constructor that creates a skulk property on whatever object is the function
    // context. The method once again returns the function context so we can test it externally.
    function Ninja(){
      this.skulk = function(){
        return this;
      }
    }

    window.onload = function(){
      // Creates two objects by invoking the constructor with new.
      // The newly created objects are referenced by ninja1 and ninja2.
      var ninja1  = new Ninja();
      var ninja2  = new Ninja();

      // Tests the method of the constructed objects.
      // Each instance should return its own constructed object.
      assert(ninja1.skulk() === ninja1,
      'The 1st ninja is skulking...');
      assert(ninja2.skulk() === ninja2,
      'The 2nd ninja is skulking....');
