    // IMPORTANT NOTES about 'Functions Invocations':
    // 4 ways that functions can be invoked:
    // 1) As a function, in which the function is invoked in a straightforward manner
    // 2) As a method, which ties the invocation to an object, enabling object-oriented programming.
    //    - When a function is assigned to a property of an object and the invocation occurs by referencing
    //      the function using that property, then the function is invoked as a method as that object.
    // 3) As a constructor, in which a new object is brought into being
    // 4) Via its apply() or call() methods, which is ki
