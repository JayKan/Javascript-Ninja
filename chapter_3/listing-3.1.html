    /*
     Functions in JavaScript are objects (Notes from JavaScripts: the good parts):
     - Objects are collection of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object.
     - Objects produced from object literals are linked to Object.prototype.
     - Functions objects are linked to Function.prototype (which is itself linked to Object.prototype)
     - Every function object is also created with a prototype property. Its value is an object with a constructor
     property whose value is the function.
     - Invoking a function 'suspends' the execution of the current function, passing control and parameters
     to the new function.
     - In addition to the declared parameters, every function receives two additional parameters:
        1) this
        2) arguments
     - The 'this' parameter is very important in object oriented programming, and its value is determined
       by the invocation pattern. There are 4 patterns of invocation in JavaScript and they are:
         1) the method invocation pattern
         2) the function invocation pattern
         3) the constructor invocation pattern
         4) the apply invocation pattern
      The patterns differ in how the bonus parameter 'this' is initialized!
     */

    /*
     The Method Invocation Pattern (1st):

     - When a function is stored as property of an object, we call it method.
     - When a method is invoked, 'this' is bound to that object.
     - A method can use 'this' to access the object so that it can retrieve values from the
       object or modify the object. The binding of 'this' to the object happens at invocation time.
     - Methods that get their object context from 'this' are called public methods.
     */
    // Create myObject. It has a value and an increment
    // method. the increment method takes an optional
    // parameter. If the argument is not a number, then 1
    // is used as the default.
    var myObject = {
      value: 0,
      increment: function(inc){
        this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
      }
    };

    myObject.increment();
    assert( myObject.value === 1, 'myObject.value should === 1');

    myObject.increment(2);
    assert( myObject.value === 3, 'myObject.value should === 3');


    /*
      The Function Invocation Pattern (2nd):

      - When a function is not the property of an object, then it is invoked as a function.
      - When a function is invoked with this pattern, 'this' is bound tot he global object.
      - This was a mistake in the design of the language. Had the language been designed correctly,
        when the inner function is invoked, 'this' would still be bound to the 'this' variable of the
        outer function. A consequence of this error is that a method cannot employ an inner function.

          message: 'adds need numbers'
        };
      }
      return a + b;
    };

    var try_it = function(){
      try {
        // - If an exception is thrown within a try block, control will go to its catch clause.
        // - A try statement has a single catch block that will catch all exceptions.
        add('seven');

    console.log('Double Value: ', myObject.value );
    assert( myObject.value === 6, 'myObject double() gets invoked and value should be doubled as 6!');

    /*
      The Constructor Invocation Pattern (3rd)

      - If a function is invoked with the 'new' prefix, then a new object will be created with a
        hidden link to the value of the function's prototype member, and 'this' will be bound to
        that newly created object.
      - The 'new' prefix also changes the behavior of the return statement!

    'myQuo instance get_status() should returned \'confused\'.');

    /*
      The Apply Invocation Pattern (4th)

      - The apply() method lets us construct an array of arguments to use to invoke a function.
      - The apply() method takes 2 arguments: this, and an array of arguments.
     */
    // Make an array of 2 numbers and add them.
    var array = [ 3, 4 ];
    var applyResult = add.apply(null, array);

    var statusObject = {
      status: 'A-OK'
    };

    // statusObject does not inherit from Quo.prototype,
    // but we can invoke the get_status method on
    // statusObject even though statusObject does not
    // have a get_status method.
    var status = Quo.prototype.get_status.apply(statusObject);
    var status_again = Quo.prototype.get_status.bind( statusObject );

    'statusObject uses Quo.prototype.get_status method via apply() to invoke itself.');
    assert(status_again() === 'A-OK',
    'status_again uses Quo.prototype.get_status method via bind()');

    /*
      - A bonus parameter that is available to functions when they are invoked is the 'arguments' array.
      - It gives the function access to all of the arguments that were supplied with the invocation.
      - Because of a design error, arguments is not REALLY an array. It is an array-like objects. Arguments
        has a length property, but it lacks ALL of the array methods.
     */
    // Make a function that adds a lot of stuffs.
    // Note that defining the variable sum inside of
    // the function does not interfere with the sum
    // defined outside of the function. The function
    // ONLY sees the inner one.
    var sum_again = function(){
      var i, ii = arguments.length, sum = 0;
      for ( i = 0; i < ii; i+=1 ) {
        sum += arguments[i];

    };
    assert( sum_again(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) === 108, 'sum_again should adds a lot of stuffs and equals to 108!');

    /*
      Return Statement:

      - The 'return' statement can be used to cause the function to return early.
      - When 'return' is executed, the function returns immediately without executing the remaining statements.
      - A function always returns a value. If the return value is not specified, then undefined is returned.
      - If the function is invoked with the 'new' prefix, aka the Constructor pattern, the return value is not an
        object, then 'this' (the new object) is returned instead.

    //      the function using that property, then the function is invoked as a method as that object.
    // 3) As a constructor, in which a new object is brought into being
    // 4) Via its apply() or call() methods
    // As a result of function invocations, invoking a function SUSPENDS the execution of the CURRENT function.
