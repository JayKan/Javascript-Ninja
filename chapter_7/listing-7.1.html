  <!-- 7.1: Testing for a specific pattern in string -->
  <script>
    /*
      IMPORTANT NOTES:
      - Regular expressions trivialize the process of tearing apart strings and looking
        for information.
      - Regular expression is simply a way to express a 'pattern' for matching strings of texts.
      - Regex literals are delimited using forward slashes in the way that string literals are delimited
        with quote characters.
      - Powerful usage of Regular expressions:
        1) Manipulating strings of HTML nodes.
        2) Locating partial selectors within a CSS selector expression.
        3) Determine if an element has a specific class name.
        4) Extracting the opacity from IE's filter property.
      - To express an actual backslash in regex, you have use \\ (double backslashes)
      - In addition to the expression itself, there are 3 flags that can be associated with a regex:
        1) i -> Makes the regex case-insensitive, so /test/i matches not only 'test', but also 'Test', 'TEST', 'tEsT' and etc.
        2) g -> Matches all instances of the pattern, as opposed to the default of 'local', which
               matches ONLY the FIRST occurrence.
        3) m -> Allows matches across multiple lines.
        Those 3 flags (i, g, or m) are appended to the END of the literal or passed in a string as the 2nd argument.
      - Alternatives can be expressed using the | (pipe) character.
